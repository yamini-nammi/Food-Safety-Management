        <h2>PREVENT THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</h2>
        <p>While FSSAIâ€™s mandate is to ensure safe and wholesome food for the country, the importance of food safety and hygiene has never been more as we navigate through these unprecedented times. As we change our lifestyles in times of social distancing to prevent further transmission of COVID-19, FSSAI is using its social media presence to help guide the communities with an appropriate course of action during this public health crisis.</p>

                    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>
                    <p>There is one worry we can shelf along with our groceries, and that is the worry of contracting COVID-19 from food or food packaging. There is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is transmitted through food or food packaging. Although it is theoretically possible to pick up the virus by touching a contaminated surface, the risk remains very low if you practice good safety habits and follow all additional recommended safety measures.</p>

                    <h3>Food workers: awareness of COVID-19 symptoms</h3>
                    <p>For the purpose of this guidance food workers include food
                        handlers, people who directly touch open food as part of their
                        work. It also includes staff who may touch food contact
                        surfaces or other surfaces in rooms where open food is
                        handled. The term can therefore apply to managers, cleaners,
                        maintenance contractors, delivery workers, and food
                        inspectors.
                        WHO recommends that people who are feeling unwell should
                        stay at home.12 Staff working in the food sector need to be
                        aware of the symptoms of COVID-19. Food business
                        operators need to produce written guidance for staff on
                        reporting such symptoms and on exclusion from work
                        policies. The most important issue is for staff to be able to
                        recognise symptoms early so that they can seek appropriate
                        medical care and testing, and minimise the risk of infecting
                        fellow workers. </p>

                    <h3>Retail food premises</h3>
                    <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the food retail sector faces
                        the greatest challenges in maintaining the highest standards
                        of hygiene, protecting staff from the risk of infection,
                        maintaining physical distancing when dealing with large
                        numbers of customers, remaining open, and ensuring that
                        adequate supplies of foods are available on a daily basis.
                        Food workers in retail premises are unlikely to contaminate
                        food if they follow standard, good personal hygiene practices
                        that reduce the risk of transmission of most foodborne
                        illnesses. Measures such as frequent handwashing, use of
                        hand sanitizers, use of protective clothing, good respiratory
                        hygiene, will reduce the risk of spreading the disease.
                        Employers should stress the importance of more frequent
                        handwashing and maintaining good hygiene practices, and ofmore frequently cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that are
                        touched regularly. Food workers need to be aware of
                        symptoms of COVID-19 and inform their employer and seek
                        medical advice if they think they have symptoms of the
                        disease. </p>
