                    <p>Organic foods are products of holistic agricultural practices focusing on bio-diversity, soil
                        health, chemical free inputs etc. with an environmentally and socially responsible approach that
                        have been produced in accordance with organic production standards.Food Safety and Standards
                        (Organic Foods) Regulations, 2017 were notified in the Gazette of India on 29.12.2017. The
                        unified logo created by FSSAI is an identity mark to distinguish organic products from
                        non-organic ones supported with the tagline “Jaivik Bharat” at the bottom, which signifies
                        Organic Food from India.</p>
