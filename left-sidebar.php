                    <h3>Eating a Balanced Diet</h3>
                    <p>A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, adequate essential amino acids
                        from protein, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and adequate calories. The requirements
                        for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods. A properly
                        balanced diet (in addition to exercise) is also thought to be important for lowering health
                        risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer.</p>

                    <h3>Food Safety Transformation</h3>
                    <p>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
                        was established in 2008 under the Ministry of Health and
                        Family Welfare in pursuance of the Food Safety and
                        Standards (FSS) Act, 2006. This Act consolidated several
                        fragmented legislations and brought them under a single
                        umbrella, making FSSAI the apex authority on all matters of
                        food safety. From a narrow focus on preventing food
                        adulteration, the mandate of FSSAI was expanded to
                        ensuring safe and wholesome food for over 130-crore
                        Indians and across the supply chain right from post-harvest
                        to consumers</p>
